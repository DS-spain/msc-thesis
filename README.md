# MSc Thesis

This thesis  addresses the challenge of high bandwidth, isolated current sensing in next generation power converters based 
on widebandgap (WBG) semiconductors (SiC and GaN). Conventional sensors such as Hall-effect, GMR, CTs and shunts are constrained by bandwidth, saturation or lack of galvanic isolation.

PCB-integrated Rogowski coils (PUCs) are presented as compact, low-cost ,galvanically isolated and highly linear sensors. Despite their advantages, PUCs are limited by low mutual inductance, requiring careful design and validation.

 â€¢ Design and characterization of three distinct topologies.
 â€¢ Proposed figures of merit (FoMs), design workflow and practical guidelines
 for sensor optimization.
 â€¢ Sensor validated on GaN Buck Converter & SiC PFC Boost Converter (CrCM).
 â€¢ Simplified quasi-static PEEC solver to compute mutual inductance for the coplanar topology.
