# MSc Thesis

This MSc project focuses on developing a PCB-integrated Rogowski current sensor to enable high-bandwidth, galvanically isolated AC current measurement in next-generation WBG power converters.

This thesis  addresses the challenge of high bandwidth, isolated current sensing in next generation power converters based 
on widebandgap (WBG) semiconductors (SiC and GaN). Conventional sensors such as Hall-effect, GMR, CTs and shunts are constrained by bandwidth, saturation or lack of galvanic isolation.

PCB-integrated Rogowski coils (PUCs) are presented as compact, low-cost, galvanically isolated and highly linear sensors. Despite their advantages, PUCs are limited by low mutual inductance, requiring careful design and validation.

This thesis covers:
 - Design and characterization of three distinct topologies.
 - Proposal of new figures of merit (FoMs), design workflow and practical guidelines
 for sensor optimization.
 - Sensor validation on GaN Buck Converter & SiC PFC Boost Converter (CrCM).
 - Design of a simplified quasi-static PEEC solver to compute mutual inductance for the coplanar topology.

## Notes

> **WARNING:** Some design steps, procedures and conclusions were deliberately omitted from the text.

> **WARNING:** The preliminary solver is not optimized and works as a proof of concept.
